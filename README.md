Please follow these instructions:

1. Browse to miniconda download page: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
Download the installation file for python 3.7 version and the operating system you are using.   
2. Install the package.
3. Now it is time to create a new environment with the required packages. On windows, open Anaconda Prompt from Start Menu, and type the following command and hit enter:<br>
```conda create -n myenv python=3.7 jupyter keras matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow```<br>
On OSX or linux, open a terminal and type in the above command.<br>
Also, if you prefer to use Spyder as Python IDE, add “spyder” at the end of the above command.<br>

This should be it. You can close this window until we get back to it in the workshop.
