Please follow these instructions:

1. Browse to miniconda download page: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
Download the installation file for python 3.7 version and the operating system you are using.   
2. Install the package.
3. Now it is time to create a new environment with the required packages. On windows, open Anaconda Prompt from Start Menu, and type the following command and hit enter:
conda create -n myenv python=3.7 jupyter keras matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
On OSX or linux, open a terminal and type in the above command.
Also, if you prefer to use Spyder as Python IDE, add “spyder” at the end of the above command. 
This should be it. You can close this window until we get back to it in the workshop.
